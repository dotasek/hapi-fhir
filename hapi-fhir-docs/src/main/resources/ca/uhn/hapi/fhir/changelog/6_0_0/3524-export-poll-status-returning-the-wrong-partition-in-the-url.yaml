title: "Previously for the multiple partitions, the URL returned from the export-poll-status is the wrong partition value. This has been fixed and will return the DEFAULT partition value in the URL whenever export-poll-status is invoked. The reason for this change is that the bulk export data is always stored in the DEFAULT partition."
